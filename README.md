# Neural network for Handwriting Recognition 

An neural network is used in the project to recognize handwritten numbers from 0 to 9. 

The network was built from scratch using Michael Nielsen's book on neural networks and deep learning as a guide.

The point on the right side is not the probability distribution.The projected digit is always shown as the top digit. The input layer is one of three layers in the network architecture. The input, hidden, and output layers each contain 784, 300, and 10 neurons. Every layer has a sigmoid activation function, and the cost is cross-entropy. The test's 89 percent accuracy rate. The network was trained using both the changed images and the original mnit dataset.
